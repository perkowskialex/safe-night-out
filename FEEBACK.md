|Contributor | Commits | Code Insertions|
|:----------:|:-------:|:--------------:|
| Alex       |   65    |     1,572      |

For this project, our expectations for your team was for an even distribution of contributions. However, we understand this was your first attempt at collaborating on a project in this cohort. Also, as a further consideration, we understand there was an increased challenge with half of you team being remote.

Nonetheless, we greatly appreciate each and every one of your amazing contributions on this project. As a final note, in the future, always foster awareness of how you can delegate and/or distribute the workload evenly; this awareness will ensure your contributions are more balanced as a team.

For your code quality, awesome work! Your didn't have any commented out (dead code) and you also added plenty of label comments all throughout `views.py`, `models.py`, and `urls.py` inside of `main_app`. You also self-documented your code with very descriptive names for your variables and functions, which made my review very easy. Thank you ðŸ˜Ž

In the end, we are very pleased with what you all created and you performed an excellent job staying consistent and communicating your ideas via Slack and Zoom over the holiday break!

Congratualtions once again on a job well done!
